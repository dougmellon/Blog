<h2 id='doug-mellon'>Douglas Mellon</h2>

I'm a software engineer based in Boulder, Colorado, and I currently build financial modeling and data infrastructure at HCG Funds, a specialty finance manager in private credit with offices in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Geneva, Switzerland.

Prior to that, I studied software engineering at the University of Northern Colorado, where I also conducted university-funded research on the use of real-time data transmission for drones in wildfire monitoring.

When I'm not sitting in front of my laptop, you'll find me backcountry skiing or biking in the Rocky Mountains, or sailing on one of Colorado's many lakes with my wife, Anna, and our husky, Juneau. We also enjoy traveling (a lot) and have been fortunate enough to have visited somewhere between 25 and 30 countries so far. Next on our list are South America and Scandinaviaâ€”if you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them! I'm always open to meeting new people, and you can email me at d(at)dougmellon.com.
